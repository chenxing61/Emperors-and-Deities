Industrial Rework
Workshops provide per city resources and bonues, but are only avaliable before Industrial Age. Only some of them can supply.
Factories are more expensive and needs demand to be built but also has global effects and can be sped up by other factories.

The national supply and demand system should start in Imperial Era and affects some workshops. But is ultimately a system for factories.

Supply and Demand

Population generate a certain amount of demand naturally,
Population + [(Population)X(%)Policy influence] + City States + Commercial Area = Demand
Each civilian Factory takes up 3 demand, take up less if they have nationalization

Liberalism/Conservative/Fascism: Commercial Area
Socialist Replacement: Commercial Quarter: Smaller and less impactful.
Anarchist Replacement: Free Store: Provide happiness instead of gold.

If demand > supply there will be 
+ building speed
- gold
- happiness

vise versa

supply > demand
+ gold
- building speed
+ happiness
+ waste material

policy and Commercial areas that provides supply without population may leads to pollution.
