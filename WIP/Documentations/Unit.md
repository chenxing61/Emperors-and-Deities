The Units of Emperors and Deities:

There are several branches added to the original unit types, there are still a bunch of special units outside of the branches, but the major ones you will always encounter.

For Land Combat:
In terms of Levied Army. We have Conscripts and Auxiliaries.

Conscripts are the most generic close combat unit accessible to that era. They don't do anything special. But they may hold the line for your other units.

Some conscripts are garrison units which specialised in defence and can build fortresses and trenches, they also aren't disbanded along with other levies.

Example: Spearman, Garrison Spearman

Auxiliaries are ranged unit with 1 range. But they make up for it with a -10% force debuff to the enemy unit adject to it. However, they are weak to rider and assault units.

Example: Levy Archer, Guerrilla
In terms of Normal Army. We have Scout, Infantry, Ranged Infantry，Light Cavalry, Heavy Assault Unit, Anti-City Siege and All purpose Siege.

Scout is a highly specialised unit with many gimmicks, they ignore enemy zone, they retreats in close combat scenarios and they gain health every turn. But they need their gimmicks to be of any value due to their low strength and weakness to ranged attack.

Example: Adventurer, Envoy

Infantry is even more generic than Conscripts, however they are stronger and gets help from military buildings. They are a force to be reckoned with. They are very reliable due to the lack of specific weapons and promotion counter to them.

Example: Swordsman, Heavy Infantry

Ranged Infantry dont have skirmisher promotion, therefore they dont give debuff to enemies but they arent weak to rider and assault units. You can easily promote them to 2 range with help from military buildings.

Example: Archer

Later down the line, Ranged Infantry behaves more like Auxiliaries and also gains many abilities. They can also be upgraded to all purpose siege.

Example: Skirmisher, Mountaineers

Light Cavalry units do have skirmisher promotion, in addition they also ignores the enemy control on tiles. So they maybe a direct upgrade on Auxiliaries, but they are somewhat fragile with their slightly lower strength.

Example: Early Riders, Hussar

Heavy Assault units are the king of battlefield. They have on average the highest strength paired with high mobility. But they are also targeted by a lot of promotions and units.

Example: Heavy Cavalry, Knight, Tank

Anti-City Siege and All purpose Siege are quite similar. Nearly identical apart from their specialisation. One have a strong anti-city focus, the other can be used to sink ships and bang on the enemy lines, however, skirmishers like scout, light cavalries, auxiliaries and later Ranged Infantry are not on that list.

Example: Trebuchet, Ballista, Self-propelled artillery, Rocket Artillery
For Naval Combat:

Because nearly all of the naval units are standing armies, the unit type is much simplier here: Its galley，sailling ship and modern navy.

Galley cannot leave coast areas but Sailling Ship can.
Galley are usually stronger than sailling ships.
But Galley gets discontinued in industrial era and replaced by more powerful and specialised modern navies.

Inside modern navies, we have screening ships like destroyer fleet, submarine fleet, which either protect embarked units or destroy them.
Capital ships like Battleship fleet and Carriers takes on the role of both assault and anti-city siege.

For Air Combat:
Not much has changed. We have bombers, fighters and low altitude aircrafts which functions like regular land unit and acts as more of a light cavalry role later in the game.
