Late Game building system

Industries: Major production & Gold & Resource Source
(Already made, but late game lacks some other stuff.)

Essential Infrastructure: Focused on Growth and Essential Happiness.
(Fire Station, Police Station, Public Water Supply, Sewer&Treatment Plant)

Inward Transport Infrastructure: Major Happiness & Growth Source, Scales with the amount of Districts. Consumes Massive amount of gold. With diverse side production.
(Mass Transit:bus, metro, tram, ferry; Bicycle Route)

Outward Transport Infrastucture: Generates immense amount of gold. At cost of increasing the supply demand and decrease of some production.
(Train Station, Variations of Airports, Mag-rails)

Communication Infrastructure: Focused on granting the public access to technologies, therefore it scales with pop and also reduces maintenance.
(Phone Line, Cellular Network, WAN support:5G upgrade...)
