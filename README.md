# Emperor and Deities
 Major Overhaul of literary everything, if you are not satisfied with how civ 5 portrays human civilizations, you ought to try this mod!

 The Mod is WIP so civs dont have their unique features currently and late game(info age) kinda sucks.

 Credit to 
 **Buckeeter aka Wadaling for making most of the vector icons(another credit to flaticon.com) and tile sets.**

 **EmperorPenguin for some help with proofreading, bug fixing advices.**

 **FastDoubloon115_ for some help with playtesting.**

 **Yanggestar from qq group chat for creating many original grahpics for the mod.**

 Special thanks to:
 Authors of Deciv and Deciv redux, Outlaw of waste, Alpha frontier, Leaders mission 1 and 2, CS reworked, Rek mod, The great unciv rework and the rest of the community.

 Great mods and bad mods both pushed me to this point. Its all your fault!

 Feedback goes to official unciv discord's Emperors and Deities thread, or just open a issue here!

 Feel free to translate this mod and send them to me, so that I may implement it in the mod.
