Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default, they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential, however, 'We Love King Day' and city state quests still require Luxury Resources. As for how you gain [Happiness], you can build a lot of buildings and create a religion with suitable beliefs."},
      {"text":"2. Army are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army','Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army'. Each with different characteristics."},

      {"text":"'Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built.
