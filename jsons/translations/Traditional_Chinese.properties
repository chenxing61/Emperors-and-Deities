Emperors and Deities is an overhaul mod for Sid Meier's Civilization 5/Unciv. = 帝王和神靈是席德梅爾的文明5/Unciv的內容重設模組。
The mod's main goal is to reshape Civ 5 into a more complex and nuanced game with many new mechanics incorporated.\nMajor Differences: = 該模組的主要目標是用新增機制和內容將文明5重設為一個更為精密且細緻的遊戲，主要分別：
1. Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default; they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential. However, 'We Love the King Day' and city-state quests still require Luxury Resources. As for how you gain [Happiness], you can build many buildings and create a religion with suitable beliefs. = 壹 · 奢侈品在正常狀態下無法提供任何[Happiness]，但是“我們愛國王日”和城邦任務仍然需要奢侈品資源。獲得[Happiness]的新途徑為大興土木修建提供[Happiness]的建築和自選合適信條創建宗教。
2. Armies are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army', 'Standing Army', 'Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army', each with different characteristics. = 貳 · 軍事單位現在主要分為四種：[徵召兵]，[常備軍]，[貴族軍]和[僱傭軍]。 都有各自不同的特點。
In other words, you cannot build a powerful army without building ['Military Building']s like [Barracks] to increase the unit limit. = 換而言之，在建立例如[Barracks]之類的['Military Building']提升單位上限之前，你的強軍大夢就是泡影。
For a more in-depth explanation = 如果想要了解更多，細閱
3. The tag system is used widely in this mod. A tag is a word surrounded by '', and many mechanics revolve around this system. They are also in the civilopedia of any object, so feel free to check. You don't need to remember this well to use it effectively as most tags are intuitive. = 叄 · 詞條系統在此mod被廣泛使用，一個詞條是被[]圍繞的一個詞。許多機制圍繞該系統展開，通過文明百科你可以得知大部分東西的詞條。你不需要把整個詞條系統記得很牢，因為大部分詞條上得非常合理。 
4. [Influence] is a new currency that affects the political status of your civilization, limited by [Influence Limit]. You get it by keeping [Happiness] positive, choosing the right policies, and through [Enact Policies] decisions. If your [Influence] is negative, you will get a negative event that lowers stability, which provides huge debuffs. You can check the civilopedia page of [Influence] for more information. = 肆 · [Influence]作為新資源可影響你文明的政治狀態。該資源的上限由[Influence Limit]決定，通過保持文明的[Happiness]為正數，選擇某些政策還有在[Enact Policies]界面進行決議，就能獲得更多[Influence]，但是[Influence]一旦進入負數，你就有機率獲得影響穩定度的負面事件。你可以通過文明百科裡面的[Influence]界面獲得詳細資訊。

ED - Starting Tips & Where to Settle = 帝神模組 - 開局貼士
When starting a new game, remember to switch to Neolithic Era if you want to build your civ from the ground up. Since Unciv defaults to Ancient Era, you might lose some content there or find some progress you didn't intend to have, like government forms being different. = 開始新遊戲時，若想從零開始建設文明，請記得切換到新石器時代。由於Unciv默認從遠古時代開始，您可能會錯過一些內容或發現一些非預期的進展，例如形態不同。
When starting a new game in Neolithic Era or Ancient Era, you would likely have two types of units: [Hunter Gatherer]s and [Settler]s. = 在新石器時代或遠古時代開始新遊戲時，您應該擁有兩種單位：[Hunter Gatherer]和[Settler]。
The major difference between Civ 5/Unciv and this mod is that your starting unit, the [Hunter Gatherer], is not only a ranged unit but also a worker that can build [Camp]s, [Manual Farm]s, and [Manual Plantation]s. However, it cannot upgrade to other units. They represent humanity's earliest endeavor at building civilizations. = 本模組與文明5/Unciv的主要區別在於，您的起始單位[Hunter Gatherer]不僅是一個遠程單位，還是一個可以建造[Camp]、[Manual Farm]和[Manual Plantation]的工人。但是，他不能升級為其他單位。他們代表了人類建設文明的最早嘗試。
As for [Settler]s, there are no major differences, but note that settling near [River]s gives 2 extra [Food] and an extra 1 [Food] near [Lakes]. These don't stack but provide a strong starting bonus for your cities. = 至於[Settler]，沒有太大區別，但請注意在[River]附近定居會額外提供2點[Food]，在[Lakes]附近額外提供1點[Food]。這些不疊加，但為您的城市提供了強大的起始加成。
With [Road Network], [Settler]s also gain +1 [Movement] on [Open terrain] after researching [Horse Collar] technology with [Cart] promotion. Neat upgrades like this exist in many places in this mod, so you should take a proper look at each option you're given. = [Settler]在修建有[Road Network]的城市裡，研究[Horse Collar]科技後還會獲得+1[Movement]的晉升[Cart]。此類實用的小升級在本模組中多處存在，因此你需要仔細查看對提供給你的選項。
When looking for a place to settle, luxury resources do give you a lot of [Gold] and other stats but are no longer a source of [Happiness]. Maintaining a balance between [Production]-giving resources like [Minerals] and [Clay], [Food] terrains like [Black Soil] and [Lakes], and [Food] resources like [Grain] and [Caprinae] makes your new cities much more useful. It is also important that you can do [Canal Construction] to connect your inland cities to the sea. And [Mountain]-requiring buildings like [Observatory] no longer require settling beside [Mountain]s; a 2-tile distance is also good enough. = 在選擇定居點時，奢侈品資源確實能提供大量[Gold]和其他產出，但不再是[Happiness]的來源。在提供[Production]的資源（如[Minerals]和[Clay]）、提供[Food]的地形（如[Black Soil]和[Lakes]）以及提供[Food]的資源（如[Grain]和[Caprinae]）之間保持平衡，將使您的新城市更加有用。此外，您可以通過[Canal Construction]將內陸城市連接到海洋，這一點也很重要。並且，需要[Mountain]的建築（如[Observatory]）不再需要緊鄰[Mountain]定居，2格距離也足夠。

ED - Stability and Events = 帝神模組 - 穩定度和事件
The original Unciv/Civ 5 offers a flat debuff when the empire is unhappy, but Emperors and Deities turned the flat debuff into instability and negative events. Negative events often interact with variables like the number of cities or what Era you are in. To cure the debuff from them, you can check out options in [Enact Policies] or in the building tab. = 原版Unciv/文明5在帝國不得人心的時候只添加了一個固定的debuff，但是帝王和神明mod將其轉變成為了低穩定度和負面事件。負面事件和諸如城市數量，所在時代之類的變數有交互。如果需要消除debuff，你可以看看[Enact Policies]或者建築界面有什麼新選項。
[Chaos Ensue] is an event that lowers your stability. It occurs if you are lacking [Happiness], [Influence], or [Gold] (going negative). It also occurs more frequently in [Unified] states. You will need to choose between spending some [Influence] and [Gold] to prevent it or having your stability lowered. This disables some abilities like building workers when you are in a state of [Strife]. = [Chaos Ensue]是一個降低穩定度的事件，它出現在你缺乏[Happiness], [Influence]或者[Gold]一路到負數的時候；而且在[Unified]狀態裡，該事件發生的機率會加大。你會需要花一點[Influence]和[Gold]消災，不然你的穩定度就會降低。負面後果例如[Strife]會使你無法建造工人單位。
To keep [Chaos Ensue] from occurring, you will need to keep your [Happiness] and [Influence] higher than normal, which is not ideal. So it is a risk you will always face. Remember to always keep some spare [Gold] and [Influence]. = 你會需要把[Happiness]和[Influence]保持在高於平常來徹底防止[Chaos Ensue]。但是這並不是最佳策略。所以你總會需要面對這個負面事件。記住常備少許[Gold]和[Influence]來應對這個。
[Wealth Gap Widens], [Rampant Corruption], and [Vagrancy Crisis] are events that only occur when you are lacking [Happiness] from the Medieval Era onward. They may apply debuffs to all the cities you own, which can be a nightmare to deal with. = [Wealth Gap Widens], [Rampant Corruption]和[Vagrancy Crisis]是只在中世紀及以後，[Happiness]缺乏時爆發的事件，它們會在全文明每座城市內散播debuff，簡直是微操夢魘。
Luckily, you can use your capital to deal with them. Unluckily, your capitals are limited, so do what you can to prevent the lack of [Happiness]. = 好消息，你可以用錢解決問題。壞消息，你的錢不是無限的，所以你需要竭盡所能防止[Happiness]缺乏。

ED - Government Forms = 帝神模組 - 形態
(This mechanic does exist in BNW, but the author of this mod never copied that.) = （此項機制確實存在於BNW中，但本模組作者並未照搬。）
Government forms like [Tribes] and [Tribal Union] are the first examples of government forms you might encounter. = 諸如[Tribes]和[Tribal Union]之類的形態是您可能最先遇到的形態範例。
A government form provides army limits like [Standing Army Maintenance], [Influence Limit]s, and unique bonuses. For [Tribes], it's a discount for policies. For [Tribal Union], it's a growth bonus and a chance to evolve into [Early Empire] in the Ancient Era through reforms. = 一種形態會提供軍隊限制（如[Standing Army Maintenance]、[Influence Limit]）和獨特加成。[Tribes]的加成是政策花費折扣。[Tribal Union]則提供增長加成，並有機會在遠古時代通過改革進化成[Early Empire]。
There are two types of government forms: ['United'] and ['Divided']. ['United'] government forms have cheaper national wonders, access to all diplomatic actions, and powerful uniques. Many historically significant empires belong to this category, like [SPQR] and [Great Qin]. = 形態分為兩種類型：['United']和['Divided']。['United']形態享有更便宜的國家奇觀造價，能使用所有外交行動，並擁有強大的獨特加成。許多歷史上重要的帝國屬於此類，例如[SPQR]和[Great Qin]。
On the other hand, it doesn't mean ['Divided'] government forms are definitely weaker. They fit into their own niche by having cheaper policy costs, access to ['Agreement'] via [Enact Policies], and generally taking less effort to maintain. = 另一方面，這並不意味著['Divided']形態就一定較弱。它們通過更低廉的政策成本、通過[Enact Policies]達成['Agreement']的能力，以及通常更易於維護的特點，找到了自身的定位。
The most convenient way to change your government form is to let it naturally evolve. When each Era begins, you are forced to have a political shift where you must actively decide what state you want to enter: ['United'] or ['Divided']. = 改變形態最便捷的方式是讓其自然演變。當每個時代開始時，您將被迫進行政治變革，必須主動決定希望進入何種狀態：['United']或['Divided']。
You can also force a political shift by having your [Influence] go above the [Influence Limit] or reform a ['United'] government form when your [Influence] is at half or above the [Influence Limit]. = 您也可以透過讓[Influence]超過[Influence Limit]，或者在[Influence]達到[Influence Limit]的一半或以上時改革['United']形態，來強制引發政治變革。
To keep a government form during a [Shift in politic] event, you would need to keep your [Influence] above 3/4 of the [Influence Limit]. = 要讓一個形態延續，你需要使[Influence]保持在在七五成[Influence Limit]之上。
['United'] government forms are gated behind the requirement of having enough [Happiness] and [Influence]. You need to have your [Influence] reach half of the [Influence Limit] and your empire being happy. = ['United']形態的啟用需要滿足足夠的[Happiness]和[Influence]要求。您需要使[Influence]達到[Influence Limit]的一半，並且您的帝國處於快樂狀態。

ED - Reworked Army Mechanic = 帝神模組 - 軍隊機制重設
Armies are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army', 'Standing Army', 'Noble Army', and 'Mercenary Army', each with different characteristics. = 軍事單位現在主要分為四種：\n[徵召兵]，[常備軍]，[貴族軍]和[僱傭軍]。 都有各自不同的特點。
'Levy Army' units are free and can be summoned using the [Call to Arms] function in any city with five or more population at the cost of [Happiness] and short-term negative effects. The [Call to Arms] status can be reverted by disbanding your levies in peaceful times using [Enact Policies] at the capital so they can be summoned again. = [徵召兵]單位是免費的，可以在任何人口達到五或以上的城市中使用[Call to Arms]功能召喚，但會消耗[Happiness]並帶來短期負面效果。[Call to Arms]狀態可以透過在和平時期於首都使用[Enact Policies]解散您的徵召部隊來解除，以便能夠再次召喚。
'Standing Army', 'Noble Army', and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units, except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built. 'Standing Army' and its elite variant 'Noble Army' are what you would rely upon most of the time; however, they do require resources like [Iron] and [Weapon Parts] to be built. = [常備軍]、[貴族軍]和[僱傭軍]的行為類似普通單位，但[僱傭軍]只能購買，且需要建造[Mercenary Office]才能招募。[常備軍]及其精英變種[貴族軍]是您在大多數時候所依賴的力量；然而，它們確實需要諸如[Iron]和[Weapon Parts]等資源來建造和維護。
The main source of [Standing Army Maintenance] is government forms and ['Military Building']s. = [Standing Army Maintenance]的主要來源是形態和['Military Building']。
The main source of [Noble Army Maintenance] is government forms and policies. = [Noble Army Maintenance]的主要來源是形態和政策。
The main source of [Mercenary Contract] is ['Economic Building']s and city-states. = [Mercenary Contract]的主要來源是['Economic Building']和城邦。

ED - Tags = 帝神模組 - 詞條
There are many tags for different buildings, resources, and units. = 不同的建築、資源和單位擁有許多詞條。
It is mostly a system for implementing strengths and weaknesses in terms of units, but for resources and buildings, it's a system that applies many buffs. = 這主要是一個用於體現單位強弱關係的系統，但對於資源和建築而言，它是一個應用多種增益的系統。
So you need to play with tags in mind. For example, when [Early Mobilization] from [Militant] gives you a bonus on constructing ['Static Defense'], you can build more [Walls]. And later adopt [Knighthood] from [Feudalism] to give them [Culture] production. = 因此您需要在遊戲中留意詞條。例如，當[Militant]提供的[Early Mobilization]賦予您建造['Static Defense']的加成時，您可以建造更多[Walls]。之後採用[Feudalism]中的[Knighthood]還能讓它們產出[Culture]。
This is a system that doesn't require overthinking. Normally, you just need to pay some attention to what you are doing, and the tag system will reward you accordingly. = 這是一個不需要過度思考的系統。通常，您只需稍微留意自己所做的事情，詞條系統便會相應地給予回報。

[Consumption Supply] and [Consumption Demand] are two new parameters you should keep in mind if you want to industrialize your civilization. = 如果你想工業化你的文明，[Consumption Supply]和[Consumption Demand]是兩大應當注意的新指標資源。 
If [Consumption Supply] outgrows [Consumption Demand] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Overproduction], which slows down the construction of new industries but adds some positive effects. = 如果[Consumption Supply]比[Consumption Demand]高出(3+當前城市數量*2），[Overproduction]就會發生，降低組建工業的速度，但是添加不少正面效果。
If [Consumption Demand] outgrows [Consumption Supply] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Underproduction], which speeds up the construction of new industries but adds some negative effects. = 如果[Consumption Demand]比[Consumption Supply]高出(3+當前城市數量*2），[Underproduction]就會發生，加快組建工業的速度，但是添加不少負面效果。
[Power] is also a new resource you should keep in mind if you want to keep your industries productive. = [Power]也是一個新的資源，可以使工業滿負荷運轉。
Every industry will consume a certain amount of [Power]. If [Power] is above [0], they will have the full benefit of electricity in cities with [Power Grid], like increased stats and resource production rates. = 所有工業都會在有[Power Grid]的城市裡面消耗[Power]，只要電力大於0，它們就會提升生產資源和提供加成的能力。
When below [7] [Industry Size], the city switches to [Low Industry Electricity Cost], consuming [6] [Power]. = 在[7] [Industry Size]以下， 城市切換至[Low Industry Electricity Cost]，消耗[6] [Power]。
When between [7] to [15] [Industry Size], the city switches to [Medium Industry Electricity Cost], consuming [12] [Power]. = 在[7]至[15] [Industry Size]之間，城市切換至[Medium Industry Electricity Cost]，消耗[12] [Power]。

ED - Invention and Innovations = 帝神模組 - 發明和革新
['Invention']s and ['Innovation']s are new buildings that represent minor technological progression and act like mini national wonders. They enable you to build certain units and buildings or give functionality boosts to existing buildings. They are built faster when other civilizations have already built them, but if you build it first, you are granted a [Gold] and [Science] boost that scales with the Era of the ['Invention'] or ['Innovation']. It is also important to state that there is no gameplay difference between ['Invention']s and ['Innovation']s. = ['Invention']和['Innovation']是以建築/國家奇觀形式存在的科技，他們給予你單位和建築的建造權限，或者升級已有建築的功能。如果其他文明已經建造了一個['Invention']或者['Innovation']，你在建造該科技時將會獲得加速，但是第一個建造這些科技的文明將會獲得一定數量的[Gold]和[Science]。獎勵隨著時代提升。除此之外，['Invention']和['Innovation']雖然名稱不同，但是在玩法層面沒有區別。
Invention bonus before Industrial Era = 工業時代前發明獎勵
