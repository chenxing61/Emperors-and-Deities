Emperors and Deities Mod Manual = 帝王和神靈模組遊玩手冊
Emperors and Deities is an overhaul mod for Sid meier's Civilization 5/Unciv. =  帝王和神靈是席德梅爾的文明5/Unciv的內容重置模組。
The mod's main goal is to reshape civ 5 into a more complex and nuanced game. With many new mechanics incorporated into the mod.\nMajor Differences: = 該模組的主要目標是用新增機製和內容將文明5重置為一個更為精密且細致的遊戲，主要分別：
1.Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default, they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential, however, 'We Love King Day' and city state quests still require Luxury Resources. As for how you gain [Happiness], you can build a lot of buildings and create a religion with suitable beliefs. = 壹·奢侈品在正常狀態下無法提供任何[Happiness]，但是「我們愛國王日」和城邦任務仍然需要奢侈品資源。獲得[Happiness]的新途徑為大興土木修建提供[Happiness]的建築和自選合適信條創建宗教。
2.Army are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army','Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army'. Each with different characteristics. = 貳·軍事單位現在主要分為四種：\n[征召兵]，[常備軍]，[貴族軍]和[雇傭軍]。 都有各自不同的特點。
'Levy Army' units are free and can be summoned using [Call to Arms] function in any city with five or more population at cost of [Happiness]  and short term negative effects, [Call to Arms] status can be reverted by disbanding your levies in peaceful times using [Enact Policies] at the capital so that they can be summoned again. = [征召兵]單位是通過在五人口以上城市號令[Call to Arms]免費建造的。但是需要耗費[Happiness]和經受短期負面效果，[Call to Arms] 狀態可被來自首都[Enact Policies]的政令在和平時期解散，然後就可以再次[Call to Arms]。
'Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built. 'Standing Army' and its elite variant 'Noble Army' is what you would rely upon most of the time, however, they do require resources like [Iron] and [Weapon Parts] to be built. = [常備軍]，[貴族軍]和[雇傭軍]都類似普通單位，但是[雇傭軍]只能在擁有[Mercenary Office]的城市被雇傭。[常備軍]和它的精英版本[貴族軍]才是是你最可靠的武裝力量。但是他們需要各色戰略資源來訓練，維護。
3.Tag system is used widely in this mod, a tag is a word surrounded using '', many mechanics revolve around this system, they are also in the civilopedia of any object, feel free to check. You don't need to remember this well to use it effectively as most tags are intuitive. = 三·詞條系統在此mod被廣泛使用，一個詞條是被[]圍繞的一個詞。許多機製圍繞該系統展開，通過文明百科你可以得知大部分東西的詞條。你不需要把整個詞條系統記得很牢，因為大部分詞條上得非常合理。
4.[Influence] is a new currency that affects the political status of your civilization. You get it by keeping the empire happy or choosing the right policies. If your [Influence] is negative, you will be getting a negative event that applies debuff. You can check the civilopedia page of [Influence] for more information. = 肆·[Influence]作為新資源可影響你文明的政治狀態。通過保持文明的幸福度或者選擇某些政策你可獲得更多[Influence]，但是[Influence]一旦進入負數，你就有概率獲得影響穩定度的負面事件。你可以通過文明百科裏面的[Influence]界面獲得詳細信息。
