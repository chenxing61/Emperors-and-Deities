This mod is kinda complicated because it incorporates many elements from other non-Civ strategy games like Paradox games to create a more historically accurate/authentic experience in the Unciv engine, but don't worry, try lower difficulty, beat the shit out of stupid AIs and you will get the hang of it eventually. All roads lead to Rome. = 这个模组显得复杂，因为它融合了许多来着非文明游戏（例如P社游戏）的机制来在Unciv的引擎内创造一个具有历史准确/历史真实感的游戏体验，不需要惊慌，尝试调低难度，把铸币AI打出屎来，世上无难事，只怕有心人。条条大路通罗马。

ED - Mod Manual = 帝神模组 - 游玩手册
Emperors and Deities is an overhaul mod for Sid Meier's Civilization 5/Unciv. = 帝王和神灵是席德梅尔的文明5/Unciv的内容重置模组。
The mod's main goal is to reshape Civ 5 into a more complex and nuanced game with many new mechanics incorporated.\nMajor Differences: = 该模组的主要目标是用新增机制和内容将文明5重置为一个更为精密且细致的游戏，主要分别：
1. Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default; they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential. However, 'We Love the King Day' and city-state quests still require Luxury Resources. As for how you gain [Happiness], you can build many buildings and create a religion with suitable beliefs. = 壹 · 奢侈品在正常状态下无法提供任何[Happiness]，但是“我们爱国王日”和城邦任务仍然需要奢侈品资源。获得[Happiness]的新途径为大兴土木修建提供[Happiness]的建筑和自选合适信条创建宗教。
2. Armies are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army', 'Standing Army', 'Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army', each with different characteristics. = 贰 · 军事单位现在主要分为四种：[征召兵]，[常备军]，[贵族军]和[雇佣军]。 都有各自不同的特点。
In other words, you cannot build a powerful army without building ['Military Building']s like [Barracks] to increase the unit limit. = 换而言之，在建立例如[Barracks]之类的['Military Building']提升单位上限之前，你的强军大梦就是泡影。
For a more in-depth explanation = 如果想要了解更多，细阅
3. The tag system is used widely in this mod. A tag is a word surrounded by '', and many mechanics revolve around this system. They are also in the civilopedia of any object, so feel free to check. You don't need to remember this well to use it effectively as most tags are intuitive. = 叁 · 词条系统在此mod被广泛使用，一个词条是被[]围绕的一个词。许多机制围绕该系统展开，通过文明百科你可以得知大部分东西的词条。你不需要把整个词条系统记得很牢，因为大部分词条上得非常合理。 
4. [Influence] is a new currency that affects the political status of your civilization, limited by [Influence Limit]. You get it by keeping [Happiness] positive, choosing the right policies, and through [Enact Policies] decisions. If your [Influence] is negative, you will get a negative event that lowers stability, which provides huge debuffs. You can check the civilopedia page of [Influence] for more information. = 肆 · [Influence]作为新资源可影响你文明的政治状态。该资源的上限由[Influence Limit]决定，通过保持文明的[Happiness]为正数，选择某些政策还有在[Enact Policies]界面进行决议，就能获得更多[Influence]，但是[Influence]一旦进入负数，你就有概率获得影响稳定度的负面事件。你可以通过文明百科里面的[Influence]界面获得详细信息。

ED - Starting Tips & Where to Settle = 帝神模组 - 开局贴士
When starting a new game, remember to switch to Neolithic Era if you want to build your civ from the ground up. Since Unciv defaults to Ancient Era, you might lose some content there or find some progress you didn't intend to have, like government forms being different. = 开始新游戏时，若想从零开始建设文明，请记得切换到新石器时代。由于Unciv默认从远古时代开始，您可能会错过一些内容或发现一些非预期的进展，例如形态不同。
When starting a new game in Neolithic Era or Ancient Era, you would likely have two types of units: [Hunter Gatherer]s and [Settler]s. = 在新石器时代或远古时代开始新游戏时，您应该拥有两种单位：[Hunter Gatherer]和[Settler]。
The major difference between Civ 5/Unciv and this mod is that your starting unit, the [Hunter Gatherer], is not only a ranged unit but also a worker that can build [Camp]s, [Manual Farm]s, and [Manual Plantation]s. However, it cannot upgrade to other units. They represent humanity's earliest endeavor at building civilizations. = 本模组与文明5/Unciv的主要区别在于，您的起始单位[Hunter Gatherer]不仅是一个远程单位，还是一个可以建造[Camp]、[Manual Farm]和[Manual Plantation]的工人。但是，他不能升级为其他单位。他们代表了人类建设文明的最早尝试。
As for [Settler]s, there are no major differences, but note that settling near [River]s gives 2 extra [Food] and an extra 1 [Food] near [Lakes]. These don't stack but provide a strong starting bonus for your cities. = 至于[Settler]，没有太大区别，但请注意在[River]附近定居会额外提供2点[Food]，在[Lakes]附近额外提供1点[Food]。这些不叠加，但为您的城市提供了强大的起始加成。
With [Road Network], [Settler]s also gain +1 [Movement] on [Open terrain] after researching [Horse Collar] technology with [Cart] promotion. Neat upgrades like this exist in many places in this mod, so you should take a proper look at each option you're given. = [Settler]在修建有[Road Network]的城市里，研究[Horse Collar]科技后还会获得+1[Movement]的晋升[Cart]。此类实用的小升级在本模组中多处存在，因此你需要仔细查看对提供给你的选项。
When looking for a place to settle, luxury resources do give you a lot of [Gold] and other stats but are no longer a source of [Happiness]. Maintaining a balance between [Production]-giving resources like [Minerals] and [Clay], [Food] terrains like [Black Soil] and [Lakes], and [Food] resources like [Grain] and [Caprinae] makes your new cities much more useful. It is also important that you can do [Canal Construction] to connect your inland cities to the sea. And [Mountain]-requiring buildings like [Observatory] no longer require settling beside [Mountain]s; a 2-tile distance is also good enough. = 在选择定居点时，奢侈品资源确实能提供大量[Gold]和其他产出，但不再是[Happiness]的来源。在提供[Production]的资源（如[Minerals]和[Clay]）、提供[Food]的地形（如[Black Soil]和[Lakes]）以及提供[Food]的资源（如[Grain]和[Caprinae]）之间保持平衡，将使您的新城市更加有用。此外，您可以通过[Canal Construction]将内陆城市连接到海洋，这一点也很重要。并且，需要[Mountain]的建筑（如[Observatory]）不再需要紧邻[Mountain]定居，2格距离也足够。

ED - Stability and Events = 帝神模组 - 稳定度和事件
The original Unciv/Civ 5 offers a flat debuff when the empire is unhappy, but Emperors and Deities turned the flat debuff into instability and negative events. Negative events often interact with variables like the number of cities or what Era you are in. To cure the debuff from them, you can check out options in [Enact Policies] or in the building tab. = 原版Unciv/文明5在帝国不得人心的时候只添加了一个固定的debuff，但是帝王和神明mod将其转变成为了低稳定度和负面事件。负面事件和诸如城市数量，所在时代之类的变量有交互。如果需要消除debuff，你可以看看[Enact Policies]或者建筑界面有什么新选项。
[Chaos Ensue] is an event that lowers your stability. It occurs if you are lacking [Happiness], [Influence], or [Gold] (going negative). It also occurs more frequently in [Unified] states. You will need to choose between spending some [Influence] and [Gold] to prevent it or having your stability lowered. This disables some abilities like building workers when you are in a state of [Strife]. = [Chaos Ensue]是一个降低稳定度的事件，它出现在你缺乏[Happiness], [Influence]或者[Gold]一路到负数的时候；而且在[Unified]状态里，该事件发生的概率会加大。你会需要花一点[Influence]和[Gold]消灾，不然你的稳定度就会降低。负面后果例如[Strife]会使你无法建造工人单位。
To keep [Chaos Ensue] from occurring, you will need to keep your [Happiness] and [Influence] higher than normal, which is not ideal. So it is a risk you will always face. Remember to always keep some spare [Gold] and [Influence]. = 你会需要把[Happiness]和[Influence]保持在高于平常来彻底防止[Chaos Ensue]。但是这并不是最佳策略。所以你总会需要面对这个负面事件。记住常备少许[Gold]和[Influence]来应对这个。
[Wealth Gap Widens], [Rampant Corruption], and [Vagrancy Crisis] are events that only occur when you are lacking [Happiness] from the Medieval Era onward. They may apply debuffs to all the cities you own, which can be a nightmare to deal with. = [Wealth Gap Widens], [Rampant Corruption]和[Vagrancy Crisis]是只在中世纪及以后，[Happiness]缺乏时爆发的事件，它们会在全文明每座城市内散播debuff，简直是微操梦魇。
Luckily, you can use your capital to deal with them. Unluckily, your capitals are limited, so do what you can to prevent the lack of [Happiness]. = 好消息，你可以用钱解决问题。坏消息，你的钱不是无限的，所以你需要竭尽所能防止[Happiness]缺乏。

ED - Government Forms = 帝神模组 - 形态
(This mechanic does exist in BNW, but the author of this mod never copied that.) = （此项机制确实存在于BNW中，但本模组作者并未照搬。）
Government forms like [Tribes] and [Tribal Union] are the first examples of government forms you might encounter. = 诸如[Tribes]和[Tribal Union]之类的形态是您可能最先遇到的形态范例。
A government form provides army limits like [Standing Army Maintenance], [Influence Limit]s, and unique bonuses. For [Tribes], it's a discount for policies. For [Tribal Union], it's a growth bonus and a chance to evolve into [Early Empire] in the Ancient Era through reforms. = 一种形态会提供军队限制（如[Standing Army Maintenance]、[Influence Limit]）和独特加成。[Tribes]的加成是政策花费折扣。[Tribal Union]则提供增长加成，并有机会在远古时代通过改革进化成[Early Empire]。
There are two types of government forms: ['United'] and ['Divided']. ['United'] government forms have cheaper national wonders, access to all diplomatic actions, and powerful uniques. Many historically significant empires belong to this category, like [SPQR] and [Great Qin]. = 形态分为两种类型：['United']和['Divided']。['United']形态享有更便宜的国家奇观造价，能使用所有外交行动，并拥有强大的独特加成。许多历史上重要的帝国属于此类，例如[SPQR]和[Great Qin]。
On the other hand, it doesn't mean ['Divided'] government forms are definitely weaker. They fit into their own niche by having cheaper policy costs, access to ['Agreement'] via [Enact Policies], and generally taking less effort to maintain. = 另一方面，这并不意味着['Divided']形态就一定较弱。它们通过更低廉的政策成本、通过[Enact Policies]达成['Agreement']的能力，以及通常更易于维护的特点，找到了自身的定位。
The most convenient way to change your government form is to let it naturally evolve. When each Era begins, you are forced to have a political shift where you must actively decide what state you want to enter: ['United'] or ['Divided']. = 改变形态最便捷的方式是让其自然演变。当每个时代开始时，您将被迫进行政治变革，必须主动决定希望进入何种状态：['United']或['Divided']。
You can also force a political shift by having your [Influence] go above the [Influence Limit] or reform a ['United'] government form when your [Influence] is at half or above the [Influence Limit]. = 您也可以通过让[Influence]超过[Influence Limit]，或者在[Influence]达到[Influence Limit]的一半或以上时改革['United']形态，来强制引发政治变革。
To keep a government form during a [Shift in politic] event, you would need to keep your [Influence] above 3/4 of the [Influence Limit]. = 要让一个形态延续，你需要使[Influence]保持在在七五成[Influence Limit]之上。
['United'] government forms are gated behind the requirement of having enough [Happiness] and [Influence]. You need to have your [Influence] reach half of the [Influence Limit] and your empire being happy. = ['United']形态的启用需要满足足够的[Happiness]和[Influence]要求。您需要使[Influence]达到[Influence Limit]的一半，并且您的帝国处于快乐状态。
List of all possible government forms = 所有可能形态列表

ED - Reworked Army Mechanic = 帝神模组 - 军队机制重置
Armies are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army', 'Standing Army', 'Noble Army', and 'Mercenary Army', each with different characteristics. = 军事单位现在主要分为四种：\n[征召兵]，[常备军]，[贵族军]和[雇佣军]。 都有各自不同的特点。
'Levy Army' units are free and can be summoned using the [Call to Arms] function in any city with five or more population at the cost of [Happiness] and short-term negative effects. The [Call to Arms] status can be reverted by disbanding your levies in peaceful times using [Enact Policies] at the capital so they can be summoned again. = [征召兵]单位是免费的，可以在任何人口达到五或以上的城市中使用[Call to Arms]功能召唤，但会消耗[Happiness]并带来短期负面效果。[Call to Arms]状态可以通过在和平时期于首都使用[Enact Policies]解散您的征召部队来解除，以便能够再次召唤。
'Standing Army', 'Noble Army', and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units, except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built. 'Standing Army' and its elite variant 'Noble Army' are what you would rely upon most of the time; however, they do require resources like [Iron] and [Weapon Parts] to be built. = [常备军]、[贵族军]和[雇佣军]的行为类似普通单位，但[雇佣军]只能购买，且需要建造[Mercenary Office]才能招募。[常备军]及其精英变种[贵族军]是您在大多数时候所依赖的力量；然而，它们确实需要诸如[Iron]和[Weapon Parts]等资源来建造和维护。
The main source of [Standing Army Maintenance] is government forms and ['Military Building']s. = [Standing Army Maintenance]的主要来源是形态和['Military Building']。
The main source of [Noble Army Maintenance] is government forms and policies. = [Noble Army Maintenance]的主要来源是形态和政策。
The main source of [Mercenary Contract] is ['Economic Building']s and city-states. = [Mercenary Contract]的主要来源是['Economic Building']和城邦。

ED - Tags = 帝神模组 - 词条
There are many tags for different buildings, resources, and units. = 不同的建筑、资源和单位拥有许多词条。
It is mostly a system for implementing strengths and weaknesses in terms of units, but for resources and buildings, it's a system that applies many buffs. = 这主要是一个用于体现单位强弱关系的系统，但对于资源和建筑而言，它是一个应用多种增益的系统。
So you need to play with tags in mind. For example, when [Early Mobilization] from [Militant] gives you a bonus on constructing ['Static Defense'], you can build more [Wall]s. And later adopt [Knighthood] from [Feudalism] to give them [Culture] production. = 因此您需要在游戏中留意词条。例如，当[Militant]提供的[Early Mobilization]赋予您建造['Static Defense']的加成时，您可以建造更多[Wall]。之后采用[Feudalism]中的[Knighthood]还能让它们产出[Culture]。
This is a system that doesn't require overthinking. Normally, you just need to pay some attention to what you are doing, and the tag system will reward you accordingly. = 这是一个不需要过度思考的系统。通常，您只需稍微留意自己所做的事情，词条系统便会相应地给予回报。

[Consumption Supply] and [Consumption Demand] are two new parameters you should keep in mind if you want to industrialize your civilization. = 如果你想工业化你的文明，[Consumption Supply]和[Consumption Demand]是两大应当注意的新指标资源。 
If [Consumption Supply] outgrows [Consumption Demand] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Overproduction], which slows down the construction of new industries but adds some positive effects. = 如果[Consumption Supply]比[Consumption Demand]高出(3+当前城市数量*2），[Overproduction]就会发生，降低组建工业的速度，但是添加不少正面效果。
If [Consumption Demand] outgrows [Consumption Supply] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Underproduction], which speeds up the construction of new industries but adds some negative effects. = 如果[Consumption Demand]比[Consumption Supply]高出(3+当前城市数量*2），[Underproduction]就会发生，加快组建工业的速度，但是添加不少负面效果。
[Power] is also a new resource you should keep in mind if you want to keep your industries productive. = [Power]也是一个新的资源，可以使工业满负荷运转。
Every industry will consume a certain amount of [Power]. If [Power] is above [0], they will have the full benefit of electricity in cities with [Power Grid], like increased stats and resource production rates. = 所有工业都会在有[Power Grid]的城市里面消耗[Power]，只要电力大于0，它们就会提升生产资源和提供加成的能力。

['Invention']s and ['Innovation']s are new buildings that represent minor technological progression and act like mini national wonders. They enable you to build certain units and buildings or give functionality boosts to existing buildings. They are built faster when other civilizations have already built them, but if you build it first, you are granted a [Gold] and [Science] boost that scales with the Era of the ['Invention'] or ['Innovation']. It is also important to state that there is no gameplay difference between ['Invention']s and ['Innovation']s. = ['Invention']和['Innovation']是以建筑/国家奇观形式存在的科技，他们给予你单位和建筑的建造权限，或者升级已有建筑的功能。如果其他文明已经建造了一个['Invention']或者['Innovation']，你在建造该科技时将会获得加速，但是第一个建造这些科技的文明将会获得一定数量的[Gold]和[Science]。奖励随着时代提升。除此之外，['Invention']和['Innovation']虽然名称不同，但是在玩法层面没有区别。
Invention bonus before Industrial Era = 工业时代前发明奖励
