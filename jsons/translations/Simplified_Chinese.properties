Emperors and Deities Mod Manual = 帝王和神灵模组游玩手册
Emperors and Deities is an overhaul mod for Sid meier's Civilization 5/Unciv. =  帝王和神灵是席德梅尔的文明5/Unciv的内容重置模组。
The mod's main goal is to reshape civ 5 into a more complex and nuanced game. With many new mechanics incorporated into the mod.\nMajor Differences: = 该模组的主要目标是用新增机制和内容将文明5重置为一个更为精密且细致的游戏，主要分别：
1.Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default, they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential, however, 'We Love King Day' and city state quests still require Luxury Resources. As for how you gain [Happiness], you can build a lot of buildings and create a religion with suitable beliefs. = 壹·奢侈品在正常状态下无法提供任何[Happiness]，但是“我们爱国王日”和城邦任务仍然需要奢侈品资源。获得[Happiness]的新途径为大兴土木修建提供[Happiness]的建筑和自选合适信条创建宗教。
2.Army are now separated into four major categories:\n 'Levy Army','Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army'. Each with different characteristics. = 贰·军事单位现在主要分为四种：\n[征召兵]，[常备军]，[贵族军]和[雇佣军]。 都有各自不同的特点。
'Levy Army' units are free and can be summoned using [Call to Arms] function in any city with five or more population at cost of [Happiness]  and short term negative effects, [Call to Arms] status can be reverted by disbanding your levies in peaceful times using [Enact Policies] at the capital so that they can be summoned again. = [征召兵]单位是通过在五人口以上城市号令[Call to Arms]免费建造的。但是需要耗费[Happiness]和经受短期负面效果，[Call to Arms] 状态可被来自首都[Enact Policies]的政令在和平时期解散，然后就可以再次[Call to Arms]。
'Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built. 'Standing Army' and its elite variant 'Noble Army' is what you would rely upon most of the time, however, they do require resources like [Iron] and [Weapon Parts] to be built. = [常备军]，[贵族军]和[雇佣军]都类似普通单位，但是[雇佣军]只能在拥有[Mercenary Office]的城市被雇佣。[常备军]和它的精英版本[贵族军]才是是你最可靠的武装力量。但是他们需要各色战略资源来训练，维护。
3.Tag system is used widely in this mod, a tag is a word surrounded using '', many mechanics revolve around this system, they are also in the civilopedia of any object, feel free to check. You don't need to remember this well to use it effectively as most tags are intuitive. = 叁·词条系统在此mod被广泛使用，一个词条是被[]围绕的一个词。许多机制围绕该系统展开，通过文明百科你可以得知大部分东西的词条。你不需要把整个词条系统记得很牢，因为大部分词条上得非常合理。
4.[Influence] is a new currency that affects the political status of your civilization, it is limited by [Influence Limit]. You get it by keeping the empire happy, choosing the right policies and through [Enact Policy] decisions. If your [Influence] is negative, you will be getting a negative event that lowers stability which provides huge amount of debuff. You can check the civilopedia page of [Influence] for more information. = 肆·[Influence]作为新资源可影响你文明的政治状态。该资源的上限由[Influence Limit]决定，通过保持文明的[Happiness]，选择某些政策还有在[Enact Policies]界面进行决议，就能获得更多[Influence]，但是[Influence]一旦进入负数，你就有概率获得影响稳定度的负面事件。你可以通过文明百科里面的[Influence]界面获得详细信息。

[Consumption Supply] and [Consumption Demand] are two new parameters you should keep in mind if you want to industrialise your civilization. = 如果你想工业化你的文明，[Consumption Supply]和[Consumption Demand]是两大应当注意的新指标资源。
If [Consumption Supply] outgrows [Consumption Demand] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Overproduction], which slows down constrcution of new industries, but adds some positive effects. = 如果[Consumption Supply]比[Consumption Demand]高出5，[Overproduction]就会发生，降低组建工业的速度，但是添加不少正面效果。
If [Consumption Demand] outgrows [Consumption Supply] by 3 + Current Number of Cities*2, you will gain [Underproduction], which speed up constrcution of new industries, but adds some negative effects. = 如果[Consumption Demand]比[Consumption Supply]高出5，[Underproduction]就会发生，加快组建工业的速度，但是添加不少负面效果。
[Power] is also a new resource you should keep in mind if you want to make your industries stay productive. = [Power]也是一个新的资源，可以使工业满负荷运转。
Every Industry will consume a certain amount of [Power], if the [Power] is above [0], they will have the full benefit of electric in cities with [Power Grid], like increased stats and resources production rate. = 所有工业都会在有[Power Grid]的城市里面消耗[Power]，它们就会提升生产资源和提供加成的能力。
